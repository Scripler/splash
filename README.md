Scripler Landing Page
=========

The Scripler landing page.

Visit the [scripler](https://github.com/Scripler/scripler/) repository for the scripler web application code.

*NB! THIS REPOSITORY IS CURRENTLY NOT USED* because scripler.com currently redirects to alpha.scripler.com and that landing/frontpage uses the Node.js backend, so the frontend code for that must be the code located in the "public" folder in the "scripler" repository.

If scripler.com ever needs to be used without the Node.js backend, this repository can again be used for the frontend code for that.
